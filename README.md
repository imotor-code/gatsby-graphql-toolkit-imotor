# Gatsby GraphQL Source Toolkit iMotor

The toolkit is a fork of [gatsby-graphql-toolkit](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-graphql-toolkit) designed to simplify data sourcing from the remote GraphQL API into Gatsby.

Note: This is **not** a source plugin by itself, but this toolkit should be used to ease the development of [source plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/creating-a-source-plugin/) by providing helper methods.
